        <h2><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>After reading numerous articles on WebAssembly and conducting some performance tests, I’d like to share my insights on this technology.</p>
<h2><span id="is-wasm-equivalent-to-assembly-level-performance">Is WASM Equivalent to Assembly-Level Performance?</span></h2>
<p>Certainly not. <strong>The assembly in WASM does not mean actual assembly code; it is a new bytecode with its own conventions that need an interpreter to run.</strong> This interpreter is much faster than a JavaScript interpreter but still falls short of native machine code performance.</p>
<p>As a reference point, when JavaScript is optimized with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, its overall performance is roughly 1/20th of machine code. In comparison, WASM can achieve about 1/3rd of machine code performance (these figures vary depending on the context and are for reference purposes only). Even if you write code in languages like C++ and Rust, the performance you get is comparable to Java and C#, not native machine code. This explains why WASM does not demonstrate overwhelming performance advantages in all application scenarios: if you know how to optimize JS to run efficiently, it can compete with Rust in the browser environment.</p>
<p>A classic case of performance comparison between WASM and JS occurred in a debate between Mozilla developers and V8 developers. Mozilla Hacks published an article titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/">“Optimizing Source Maps Performance with Rust and WebAssembly”</a>, optimizing the performance of the source-map JavaScript package by five times. V8 core developer Vyacheslav Egorov responded with an article titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/">“You Might Not Need Rust and WebAssembly to Speed Up Your JS”</a>, achieving astonishing optimizations in pure JS that outperformed Rust. The debate was intense, and the performance comparison chart after three rounds clearly showed Rust’s superiority, although JS managed to outperform in one round:</p>
<p><img src="/img/wasm/Rust&amp;Js.png" alt="Rust&amp;Js"></p>
<p>Additionally, Milo Yip conducted performance tests on different languages for ray tracing (a highly intensive computation task), supporting the conclusion about performance comparisons between languages and machine code. C++, Java, and JS, without specific optimizations, can represent three typical performance levels:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cnblogs.com/miloyip/archive/2010/07/07/languages_brawl_GI.html">Language Rendering Comparison (C++/C#/F#/Java/JS/Lua/Python/Ruby)</a></p>
<h2><span id="is-wasm-faster-than-js-so-it-should-be-used-for-compute-intensive-applications">Is WASM Faster Than JS, So It Should Be Used for Compute-Intensive Applications?</span></h2>
<p>This assumption is a bit biased. <code>WASM</code> is still processed on the CPU. For tasks that can be highly parallelized, using <code>WebGL</code> for GPU acceleration is often much faster. For instance, algorithms for image processing, as I discussed in my article [“Practical WebGL Image Processing Introduction”](link to the article), can easily be several tens of times faster by using WebGL than by looping through canvas pixels in JS.</p>
<p>Rewriting such a nested loop in WASM to achieve a few times improvement over JS is already considered quite good. Regarding AI computations in the browser, community evaluations show that WebGL and WebMetal offer the highest performance levels, followed by WASM. Refer to this article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.logrocket.com/ai-in-browsers-comparing-tensorflow-onnx-and-webdnn-for-image-classification/">“Browser-Based AI Evaluations”</a></p>
<p>However, WebGL acceleration has precision issues. For example, the core of the frontend image resizing library Pica uses the Lanczos sampling algorithm. I implemented this algorithm with WebGL shaders; it is not complicated. The early version of Pica once included optional WebGL optimizations, but now it has shifted to WASM. The reason is that WASM can ensure consistent computation results with JS for the same parameters, whereas WebGL cannot. For related discussions, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/nodeca/pica/issues/114">Issue #114 · nodeca/pica</a></p>
<p>Moreover, there are not many compute-intensive scenarios in frontend development. Tasks like encryption, compression, and mining are not high-frequency requirements. As for potentially essential AI applications in the future, <strong>I personally have confidence in WebGPU, the next-generation standard that can fully unleash GPU potential. However, WASM is already a good alternative.</strong></p>
<h2><span id="does-embedding-a-wasm-function-in-js-automatically-improve-performance">Does Embedding a WASM Function in JS Automatically Improve Performance?</span></h2>
<p>Not necessarily. Modern JS engines have powerful tools for performance optimization, namely <code>JIT</code> (Just-In-Time compilation). Simply put, if a function like the <code>add</code> function in the code <code>const add = (a, b) =&gt; a + b</code> consistently performs integer addition, the JS engine will automatically compile machine code to compute <code>int a + int b</code>, replacing the original JS function. This optimization significantly enhances the performance of frequent calls to this function. This is the magic of JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation.</p>
<p>So, don’t assume that JS is slow and think of manually replacing such JS functions with C compiled to WASM to improve performance. Modern JS engines automatically “translate JS to C” like this for you! If you can rewrite a JS function into equivalent C code, it’s highly likely that this function, when inlined, will achieve similar performance through JIT compilation. This is probably why V8 developers confidently challenged Rust with JS in the debate I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In the article <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/calls-between-javascript-and-webassembly-are-finally-fast-%F0%9F%8E%89/">“Calls between JavaScript and WebAssembly are Finally Fast 🎉”</a>, Lin Clark eloquently discusses the optimization process. <strong>In the end, function calls between JS and WASM are faster than non-inlined JS function calls.</strong> However, the comparison between these calls and JS functions that are inlined by JIT is not mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that Mozilla often promotes their massively optimized work, much of which might have stemmed from apparent design issues (let’s be honest; we all have our moments). For instance, the significant power-saving optimization in Firefox 70 for Mac was rooted in what exactly? A rough understanding is that the previous version of Firefox on Mac updated the window pixels for every frame! Of course, these articles contain substantial information, and I highly recommend reading the original texts after building a good foundation. It opens up a broader world and often inspires insights into software architecture design.</p>
<p>If WASM supports garbage collection (GC) in the future, managing object lifecycles between JS and WASM may become more complicated. For example, I recently attempted to synchronize large objects between Dart in Flutter and Java in Android, hoping to “embed some Android platform capabilities into the Flutter ecosystem.” However, this approach led to a lot of verbose and low-performance glue code. Objects had to be deep-copied asynchronously through messages, with very low controllability. Although WASM currently does not have GC, once it’s added, I have reasons to suspect that managing object lifecycles between WASM and JS will face similar challenges. However, this problem mainly concerns Mozilla and Google developers; it’s not something we need to worry about.</p>
<h2><span id="is-wasm-just-like-calling-c-from-python-in-terms-of-simplicity">Is WASM Just Like Calling C from Python in Terms of Simplicity?</span></h2>
<p>This question can only be answered by practical experience. For example, I have recently attempted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling C++ from Java classes in Android</li>
<li>Calling C from Dart in Flutter</li>
<li>Calling C/C++ from QuickJS, an embedded JS engine</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these cases involve creating native objects in the engine and passing them to C/C++ functions by reference. This method is generally referred to as <code>FFI (Foreign Function Interface)</code>, allowing native code to be embedded in language runtimes. However, if you are dealing with two different runtimes, things are not that simple. <strong>For instance, in the Quack project, which aims to bind QuickJS with Java, marshaling (similar to serialization and deserialization like JSON) has to be done between JS and Java objects; you cannot simply pass references.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, how does it work with WASM?</strong> Essentially, WASM’s linear memory can be freely read and written by JS, without the hassle of deep copying. However, WASM does present some challenges in terms of data flow. It only supports basic data types such as integers and floats; there is no support for complex data structures like strings. Thus, for slightly more complex objects, it’s challenging to manually define corresponding structures on both the JS and WASM sides. This difficulty makes it complicated to directly perform complex object transformations using WASM. Currently, this dirty work is left to tools like <code>wasm-bindgen</code>, which handles complex object transformations between languages. <code>wasm-pack</code> uses another tool called <code>wasm-bindgen</code> to bridge JavaScript and Rust, among other types. However, this process is not the same as directly embedding C/C++ functions in JS runtime, as with traditional FFI compiled to machine code.</p>
<p>For example, if you frequently manipulate JS objects with WASM, it can almost certainly impact performance. A typical pitfall in this regard is porting OpenGL applications to WASM. For example, a function like <code>glTexImage2D</code> in C++ now needs to go through two layers: first, it goes from WASM to JS in the glue layer, and then from JS to WebGL API like <code>gl.texImage2D</code> through C++ binding. This adds an extra layer of complexity compared to directly writing the equivalent JS code. Can this approach match the performance of writing JS directly instead of two layers of glue code?</p>
<p>Of course, Mozilla is aware of this issue. Hence, they are exploring how to better expose <code>Web IDL (the bindings of browser-native APIs)</code> to WASM. In this process, they introduced the concept of <code>WASM Interface Types</code>: since WASM is already an intermediate bytecode, why not establish a universal Intermediate Representation (IR) specification that can unify all types across programming language runtimes? However, this specification hopes to solve problems mainly through protocolization and structured deep copying, with only the <code>anyref</code> type allowing passing by reference. <code>anyref</code> behaves somewhat like file descriptors in Unix; I won’t delve into this here.</p>
<p><img src="/img/wasm/Rust&amp;Js3.webp" alt="Js2WASM"></p>
<h2><span id="is-wasm-part-of-the-frontend-ecosystem">Is WASM Part of the Frontend Ecosystem?</span></h2>
<p>I do not agree with this statement. It’s essential to note that the toolchains for compiling WASM applications and the libraries they depend on have little to do with JS.</p>
<p>A toolchain that supports cross-compilation typically comes with libraries supporting the target platform. For example, after including <code>&lt;GLES2/gl2.h&gt;</code>, the <code>glTexImage2D</code> API you call is provided by the dynamic library. This API can run consistently on x86, ARM, MIPS, WASM, etc., platforms (similar to <code>.so</code> files in Android). Emscripten provides a set of dynamic libraries specifically for the WASM platform, compiling them into JS format. However, it only guarantees that these APIs are available; performance is a different story. Emscripten also provides many optimization suggestions for porting WebGL applications.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to reiterate that the dependencies and toolchains required to compile WASM applications are almost entirely unrelated to JS. JS is just a format produced by these toolchains, similar to machine code. From the perspective of JS developers, these toolchains may seem quite unfamiliar. Still, from the perspective of native application developers, everything is quite standard.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>WebAssembly is undoubtedly a revolutionary technology, representing a new cross-platform direction, especially valuable for native application developers. However, for frontend developers, it’s just a bytecode virtual machine embedded in the browser.</p>
<p>I hope this article clarifies some misconceptions and provides a better understanding of WebAssembly’s capabilities and limitations. While it’s a powerful tool, it’s essential to use it judiciously and consider its advantages and trade-offs within the context of your specific use case. Remember, WebAssembly is not a magic solution that automatically improves performance in all scenarios. It’s another option in the toolkit, providing a balance between performance, development cost, and effectiveness. As the technology evolves, it will be interesting to see how it integrates further into the broader web ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the given code, when accessing <code>obj.foo.bar</code>, it first reads the value of <code>obj.foo</code>. Here, <code>Reflect.get</code> is used to directly return the result of <code>obj.foo</code>. Since the result obtained through <code>Reflect.get</code> is a plain object, namely <code>&#123; bar: 1 &#125;</code>, it is not a reactive object. Therefore, when accessing <code>obj.foo.bar</code> inside the effect function, no reactivity is established. To address this, the result returned by <code>Reflect.get</code> needs to be wrapped:</p>

<p>In this code snippet, the <code>reactive</code> function is defined. It takes an object as a parameter and returns a proxy of that object. The proxy uses a <code>get</code> trap function that triggers when accessing a property of the object. In the <code>get</code> trap, <code>Reflect.get</code> is used to retrieve the property value. If the result is an object, it is made reactive by calling the <code>reactive</code> function recursively. This ensures that nested objects also possess reactive properties, allowing modifications to trigger the reactivity system.</p>
<h2><span id="shallow-reactivity">Shallow Reactivity</span></h2>
<p>However, there are scenarios where deep reactivity is not desired, leading to the concept of <code>shallowReactive</code> or shallow reactivity. Shallow reactivity means that only the top-level properties of an object are reactive. For example:</p>
<p>Suppose we have an object with a nested object as its property:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> obj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>If we apply deep reactivity to <code>obj</code>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> reactiveObj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">reactive</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Any modifications to <code>obj</code> or <code>innerObj</code> properties will trigger the reactivity system:</p>

<p>However, if we want only the top-level properties of <code>obj</code> to be reactive, meaning modifications to <code>obj</code> trigger reactivity but modifications to <code>innerObj</code> do not, we use the <code>shallowReactive</code> function:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> shallowReactiveObj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">shallowReactive</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

<h2><span id="vuejs-and-reactive-vs-shallowreactive">Vue.js and <code>reactive</code> vs <code>shallowReactive</code></span></h2>
<p>In Vue.js, both <code>reactive</code> and <code>shallowReactive</code> functions are used to create reactive objects. Let’s explore their differences.</p>
<p>The <code>reactive</code> function creates deeply reactive objects. This means that both the object itself and all its nested objects become reactive. Any modifications to the object or its nested objects’ properties will trigger the reactivity system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <code>shallowReactive</code> function creates shallowly reactive objects. This means that only the top-level properties of the object are reactive. If the object contains nested objects, modifications to those nested objects’ properties will not trigger the reactivity system.</p>

<h2><span id="readonly-and-shallow-readonly">Readonly and Shallow Readonly</span></h2>
<p>After discussing reactivity and shallow reactivity, let’s talk about readonly and shallow readonly:</p>
<p>Vue.js provides <code>readonly</code> and <code>shallowReadonly</code> functions to create readonly reactive objects.</p>
<p>The <code>readonly</code> function creates deeply readonly reactive objects. This means that both the object itself and all its nested objects are readonly. Any attempts to modify the object or its nested objects’ properties will fail.</p>
<p>The <code>shallowReadonly</code> function creates shallow readonly reactive objects. This means that only the top-level properties of the object are readonly. If the object contains nested objects, properties of these nested objects can be modified.</p>

        <h2><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Since Vue.js 3’s reactive data is based on Proxy, it’s essential to understand Proxy and its associated concept, Reflect. What is Proxy? In simple terms, Proxy allows you to create a proxy object. It can proxy other objects, emphasizing that Proxy can only proxy objects and not non-object values like strings, booleans, etc. So, what does proxying mean? Proxying refers to the act of creating a basic semantic representation of an object. It allows us to intercept and redefine the basic operations on an object.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">Create object proxies with Proxy</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect">Built-in object Reflect</a></p>
<p>When we talk about “basic semantics” in programming languages, we mean the fundamental operations for reading and modifying data. In JavaScript, these operations typically include reading property values and setting property values. For example, given an object <code>obj</code>, the following operations are considered basic semantics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read property value: <code>obj.foo</code> (reads the value of property <code>foo</code>)</li>
<li>Set property value: <code>obj.foo = newValue</code> (sets the value of property <code>foo</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the above code, <code>Proxy</code> objects allow us to intercept (or redefine) these basic semantic operations. The <code>Proxy</code> constructor takes two parameters: the object being proxied and an object containing interceptors (also known as traps). In the interceptor object, we can define the <code>get</code> method to intercept property read operations and the <code>set</code> method to intercept property set operations. This way, we can execute custom logic when these operations occur.</p>
<p>Understanding these basic semantic operations and how to use <code>Proxy</code> and <code>Reflect</code> to intercept and handle them is crucial for implementing reactive data in JavaScript. In reactive data, we can use <code>Proxy</code> and <code>Reflect</code> to track reads and modifications of object properties, enabling reactive updates of data.</p>
<h2><span id="basic-usage-of-proxy">Basic Usage of Proxy</span></h2>
<p>When we talk about basic semantics, we refer to fundamental operations in JavaScript, such as reading object property values and setting object property values. Consider the following object <code>obj</code>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> obj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span> <span class="token literal-property property">foo</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>obj.foo</code> is a basic semantic operation for reading property values, and <code>obj.foo = newValue</code> is a basic semantic operation for setting property values.</p>
<p>Now, we can use <code>Proxy</code> to intercept these basic semantic operations.</p>

<p>In the above code, we created a <code>handler</code> object that defines <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods to intercept property reads and sets. Then, we created a proxy object <code>proxyObj</code> using the <code>Proxy</code> constructor, which intercepts read and set operations on the <code>obj</code> object. When we access <code>proxyObj.foo</code>, the <code>get</code> method is triggered, outputting the corresponding message. When we set the value of <code>proxyObj.foo</code>, the <code>set</code> method is triggered, again outputting the corresponding message.</p>
<p>This way, <code>Proxy</code> allows us to execute custom logic when basic semantic operations occur, without directly manipulating the original object. In practical applications, this capability can be used to implement reactive data, data validation, logging, and more.</p>
<p>When intercepting object property reads with <code>Proxy</code>, special attention is required for accessor properties because accessor properties are defined using getter functions. The <code>this</code> keyword inside these getter functions changes based on the method of invocation.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we use <code>Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)</code> instead of <code>target[key]</code> when accessing property values. This ensures that the <code>receiver</code> parameter correctly points to the proxy object, not the original object. Consequently, within the getter function of accessor properties, the <code>this</code> keyword refers to the proxy object, establishing the correct reactive relationship.</p>
<p>Here is the corrected code using <code>Reflect.get</code>:</p>

<p>In this code, we use <code>Reflect.get</code> with the <code>receiver</code> parameter to ensure that <code>this</code> points to the proxy object within the <code>get</code> interceptor function. This establishes the correct reactive relationship, allowing proper dependency tracking when accessing object properties.</p>
<h2><span id="usage-of-reflect-in-reactivity">Usage of Reflect in Reactivity</span></h2>
<p>In interceptor functions, we aim to establish a connection between side-effect functions and reactive data. This ensures that when properties are accessed, the correct dependencies are tracked, enabling re-execution of side-effect functions when properties change. However, if we directly use <code>target[key]</code> to access property values, the <code>this</code> keyword inside the getter function of accessor properties points to the original object, not the proxy object. This prevents the establishment of the correct reactive relationship.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we use <code>Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)</code> instead of <code>target[key]</code>. By doing so, the <code>receiver</code> parameter correctly points to the proxy object, allowing the <code>this</code> keyword inside the getter function to refer to the proxy object. This establishes the proper reactive relationship.</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating the use of the <code>receiver</code> parameter and comparing it with the scenario where the <code>receiver</code> parameter is not used:</p>

<p>In this example, we did not use the <code>receiver</code> parameter. Since the <code>receiver</code> parameter was not passed, <code>this</code> inside the <code>get</code> interceptor function points to the original object <code>data</code>. Although the proxy object <code>proxy</code> is used, the <code>this</code> inside the <code>get</code> interceptor function does not refer to <code>proxy</code> but instead refers to the original object <code>data</code>. Therefore, in this scenario, the reactive relationship is not established.</p>
<p>While the output of the two functions is the same, it’s evident that without using the <code>receiver</code> parameter, the reactive relationship is not established. This means that within the <code>effect</code> function, the object will not receive the correct reactivity.</p>

        <h2><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>When we talk about race conditions, it typically refers to a concurrency problem in multi-process or multi-threaded programming. However, in frontend development, we might not directly encounter multi-threaded programming frequently, but we often face similar situations related to race conditions. A common example is in asynchronous programming, especially when dealing with asynchronous events, callback functions, or Promises.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the following asynchronous code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> data<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  <span class="token function">setTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    data <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Fetched data'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1000</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>

<span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>data<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// Outputs undefined</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>fetchData</code> function is asynchronous, and it assigns the data to the <code>data</code> variable after 1 second. However, due to JavaScript’s single-threaded nature, the <code>fetchData</code> function waits in the main thread’s event queue for 1 second. Within this 1 second, the <code>console.log(data)</code> statement executes immediately, and at that point, the value of <code>data</code> is <code>undefined</code> because the <code>fetchData</code> function has not completed yet.</p>
<p>In asynchronous programming, due to the non-blocking nature of the code, similar race condition issues can arise. When dealing with asynchronous operations, it’s crucial to ensure data consistency and correctness, avoiding accessing or modifying related data before the asynchronous operation is completed.</p>
<h2><span id="race-conditions-and-reactivity">Race Conditions and Reactivity</span></h2>
<p>So, how are race conditions related to reactivity?</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> finalData<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Send and wait for a network request</span>
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> res <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'/path/to/request'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Assign the request result to data</span>
  finalData <span class="token operator">=</span> res<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this code snippet, we use the <code>watch</code> function to observe changes to the <code>obj</code> object. Every time the <code>obj</code> object changes, a network request, such as an API call, is sent. After the data request is successful, the result is assigned to the <code>finalData</code> variable. At first glance, this code might seem fine. However, upon closer inspection, you’ll realize that this code can lead to race condition problems. Let’s assume we modify a field of the <code>obj</code> object for the first time, triggering the callback function and sending the first request A. As time passes, before the result of request A returns, we modify a field of the <code>obj</code> object again, triggering the second request B. Now, both request A and request B are in progress. Which request will return its result first? We don’t know. If request B completes before request A, the finalData variable will store the result of request B, making request A’s result outdated.</p>
<p><img src="/img/expired-side-sffect/expired-side-sffect.png" alt="Comparison"></p>
<p>However, because request B was sent later, we consider its data as the “latest.” Request A is deemed “expired,” and its result should be invalidated. By ensuring that request B’s result is considered the latest, we can prevent errors caused by race conditions. Essentially, what we need is a way to expire side effects. To illustrate this concept further, let’s replicate the scenario using the <code>watch</code> function in Vue.js to see how Vue.js helps developers address this problem. Later, we’ll attempt to implement this functionality ourselves.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">newValue<span class="token punctuation">,</span> oldValue<span class="token punctuation">,</span> onInvalidate</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

<p>As shown in the code above, before sending the request, we define an <code>expired</code> flag variable to indicate whether the current side effect has expired. We then call the <code>onInvalidate</code> function to register an expiration callback. When the side effect expires, the <code>expired</code> flag is set to <code>true</code>. Finally, we use the request result only if the side effect has not expired, effectively avoiding the issue described earlier.</p>

        <h2><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Previously, we discussed the <code>effect</code> function, which is used to register side-effect functions. It allows specifying options parameters, such as the <code>scheduler</code> to control the timing and manner of side-effect function execution. We also explored the <code>track</code> function for dependency tracking and the <code>trigger</code> function to re-execute side-effect functions. Combining these concepts, we can implement a fundamental and distinctive feature of Vue.js – computed properties.</p>
<h2><span id="computed-properties-and-the-lazy-option">Computed Properties and the <code>lazy</code> Option</span></h2>
<p>In Vue.js, the <code>effect</code> function is used to create reactive side-effect functions. By default, side-effect functions passed to <code>effect</code> are executed immediately. For example, in the code below, the side-effect function passed to the <code>effect</code> function is executed immediately:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span>foo<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>However, in certain cases, we want the side-effect function to execute only when needed, not immediately. A typical scenario is with computed properties. To achieve this delayed execution, we can add a <code>lazy</code> property to the <code>options</code> object and set it to <code>true</code>. When <code>lazy</code> is <code>true</code>, the side-effect function is not executed during initialization but only when necessary. The modified code looks like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>
  <span class="token comment">// This function will not execute immediately</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span>foo<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token comment">// options</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    <span class="token literal-property property">lazy</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the implementation, the side-effect function <code>effectFn</code> is returned as the result of the <code>effect</code> function. This means that when we call the <code>effect</code> function, we get the corresponding side-effect function and can manually execute it when needed. This mechanism gives us more control, allowing us to decide when to trigger the execution of the side-effect function rather than executing it immediately.</p>
<p>This design pattern is particularly suitable for specific scenarios like computed properties. In computed properties, we might want to trigger the side-effect function’s execution at a specific moment rather than immediately during initialization. By returning the side-effect function from the <code>effect</code> function, we can flexibly control when the side-effect function is executed to meet different requirements in various scenarios.</p>

<p>In this code, the <code>effect</code> function’s second parameter is an <code>options</code> object, where the <code>lazy</code> property is set to <code>true</code>. This means that the side-effect function passed to <code>effect</code> will be executed only when necessary, such as when accessing a computed property. The <code>lazy</code> property allows us to control the immediate execution of the side-effect function.</p>
<p>Now that we have achieved lazy computation through computed properties, how do we implement data caching?</p>

<p>With lazy computation resolved, the <code>value</code> is calculated only when it is truly needed, executing <code>effectFn</code> only when necessary. Additionally, a <code>dirty</code> flag is introduced to indicate whether the current computation needs to be recalculated. If <code>dirty</code> is <code>true</code>, the <code>value</code> is recalculated, and the <code>dirty</code> flag is set to <code>false</code> so that the cached value can be used directly next time.</p>
<h2><span id="implementation-principle-of-watch">Implementation Principle of <code>watch</code></span></h2>
<p>The concept of watch essentially involves observing a reactive data and executing the corresponding callback function when the data changes. For example:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>obj<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token comment">// Modifying the reactive data triggers the execution of the callback function</span>

<p>Suppose <code>obj</code> is a reactive data, watched using the <code>watch</code> function with a provided callback function. When modifying the reactive data’s value, the callback function is triggered. In fact, the implementation of <code>watch</code> essentially utilizes the <code>effect</code> and the <code>options.scheduler</code> option, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

<p>In a side-effect function accessing the reactive data <code>obj.foo</code>, based on the previous discussion, we know that this establishes a connection between the side-effect function and the reactive data. When the reactive data changes, the side-effect function is re-executed. However, there is an exception: if the side-effect function has a <code>scheduler</code> option, when the reactive data changes, the <code>scheduler</code> function is executed instead of directly triggering the side-effect function. From this perspective, the <code>scheduler</code> function acts as a callback function, and the implementation of <code>watch</code> utilizes this characteristic.</p>
<p>Below is the simplest implementation of the <code>watch</code> function:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// The watch function receives two parameters: source (reactive data) and cb (callback function)</span>

<p>In this code, we first define an original data object named <code>data</code>, which contains a property <code>foo</code> with an initial value of 1. Next, we create a proxy object <code>obj</code> using Proxy, intercepting operations on the data.</p>
<p>When <code>obj.foo++</code> is executed, the set interceptor of Proxy is triggered. In the set interceptor, we first set the property value on the target object and then call the <code>watch</code> function, passing <code>obj</code> and a callback function. In the <code>watch</code> function, we use a hypothetical <code>effect</code> function (which might be provided by a framework) to listen for data changes.</p>

<p>In the code above, <code>effectFn1</code> is nested within <code>effectFn2</code>. The execution of <code>effectFn1</code> will trigger the execution of <code>effectFn2</code>. So, when do we encounter nested effects? Take Vue.js, for example; Vue.js’s rendering function is executed within an effect.</p>
<p>When components are nested, for instance, when the Foo component renders the Bar component:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Bar component</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> Bar <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

<p>The <code>effect</code> function can be nested, meaning an <code>effect</code> function can contain another <code>effect</code> function. When an outer <code>effect</code> function depends on reactive data created inside an inner <code>effect</code> function, the inner <code>effect</code> function is automatically tracked, ensuring that the outer <code>effect</code> function is executed when the inner <code>effect</code> function changes.</p>
<p>This nested structure of effect functions establishes a dependency chain, ensuring that when reactive data changes, all the effect functions dependent on it are triggered, thereby maintaining the responsiveness of the application.</p>
<p>The “effect stack” in Vue 3’s internal implementation is crucial. Vue uses an effect stack to track the currently executing effect functions, similar to a function call stack. This stack manages the execution order and dependency relationships of effect functions.</p>
<p>Now, let’s consider an example of a nested <code>effect</code> function without using a stack structure. However, it cannot achieve the desired nesting functionality. Let’s assume we have two reactive data, <code>count1</code> and <code>count2</code>, where the value of <code>count2</code> depends on the value of <code>count1</code>. We can use nested <code>effect</code> functions to establish this dependency relationship.</p>

<p><code>effectFn1</code> is the outer <code>effect</code> function, which depends on the value of <code>obj.foo</code>. It contains an <code>innerEffect</code> within it. The inner <code>effect</code> function, <code>effectFn2</code>, depends on the value of <code>obj.bar</code>. When we modify <code>obj.foo</code>, the outer <code>effect</code> function should be triggered and output the value of <code>obj.foo</code>. When we modify <code>obj.bar</code>, the inner <code>effect</code> function should be triggered and output the value of <code>obj.bar</code>.</p>
<p>We use the global variable <code>activeEffect</code> to store the effect functions registered through the <code>effect</code> function. This means that at any given time, <code>activeEffect</code> stores only one effect function.</p>

<p>However, by only using a single variable for storage without employing a stack structure, when nested effects occur, the execution of the inner effect function will overwrite the value of <code>activeEffect</code>. It will never be restored to its original value. If there is a reactive data performing dependency collection, even if it is read within the outer effect function, the collected effect functions will all be from the inner effect function. In other words, when I read <code>obj.foo</code>, <code>activeEffect</code> still refers to the value of <code>innerEffect</code>, and only the <code>innerEffect</code> is triggered.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we need an effect function stack called <code>effectStack</code>. When an effect function is executed, the current effect function is pushed onto the stack. After the execution of the effect function is completed, it is popped from the stack. The <code>activeEffect</code> is always set to the top effect function on the stack. This ensures that a reactive data will only collect the effect function that directly reads its value, preventing mutual interference:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>body<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerText <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'hello vue3'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>When the <code>effect</code> function is executed, it sets the text content of the body. Any function other than <code>effect</code> can read or modify the body’s text content. In other words, the execution of the <code>effect</code> function directly or indirectly affects the execution of other functions, indicating that the <code>effect</code> function has side effects.</p>
<p>Side effect functions are common and can impact various aspects, such as the effectiveness of “tree shaking” in webpack, a topic we discussed earlier. I won’t delve into this here.</p>
<p>Side effects can easily occur; for example, if a function modifies a global variable, it creates a side effect, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Global variable</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> val <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  val <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// Modifying a global variable creates a side effect</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Understanding side effect functions, let’s now discuss reactive data. Suppose a property of an object is read within a side effect function:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> obj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span> <span class="token literal-property property">text</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'hello world'</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">effect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  <span class="token comment">// The execution of the effect function reads obj.text</span>
  document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>body<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerText <span class="token operator">=</span> obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span>text<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>The side effect function <code>effect</code> sets the <code>innerText</code> property of the body element to <code>obj.text</code>. When the value of <code>obj.text</code> changes, we want the side effect function <code>effect</code> to re-execute.</p>
<p>Our approach is as follows: we want to store the <code>effect</code> function in a bucket when reading the <code>obj.text</code> value, and when setting the <code>obj.text</code> value, we want to retrieve the <code>effect</code> function from the bucket and execute it.</p>
<h2><span id="basic-implementation-of-reactive-data">Basic Implementation of Reactive Data</span></h2>
<p>How can we make <code>obj</code> reactive data? By observing, we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the side effect function <code>effect</code> is executed, it triggers the read operation of the <code>obj.text</code> property.</li>
<li>When the <code>obj.text</code> value is modified, it triggers the write operation of the <code>obj.text</code> property.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to intercept the read and write operations of an object property.</p>
<p>Before ES2015, this could only be done using the <code>Object.defineProperty</code> function, which was also the approach used in Vue.js 2. In ES2015 and later, we can use the Proxy object to achieve this, and this is the approach adopted in Vue.js 3.</p>

<p>Here, we create a reactive object based on the Proxy object. We have a <code>proxyMap</code>, which is a container for storing various types of proxies. We define <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> intercept functions to intercept read and write operations.</p>
<h2><span id="designing-a-comprehensive-reactive-system">Designing a Comprehensive Reactive System</span></h2>
<p>From the above examples, it’s clear that the workflow of a reactive system is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a read operation occurs, collect the side effect functions into a “bucket”.</li>
<li>When a write operation occurs, retrieve the side effect functions from the “bucket” and execute them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I’ll explain the principles through a simple implementation of a reactive system.</p>
<p>We know that the Proxy object can accept an object with getters and setters for handling get or set operations. Therefore, we can create a <code>baseHandlers</code> to manage getters and setters.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// baseHandlers</span>

<p>We also need to establish a clear link between side effect functions and the target fields being operated upon. For instance, when reading a property, it doesn’t matter which property is being read; all side effect functions should be collected into the “bucket.” Similarly, when setting a property, regardless of which property is being set, the side effect functions from the “bucket” should be retrieved and executed. There is no explicit connection between side effect functions and the operated fields. The solution is simple: we need to establish a connection between side effect functions and the operated fields. This requires redesigning the data structure of the “bucket” and cannot be as simple as using a Set type for the “bucket.”</p>
<p>We use <code>WeakMap</code> to implement the bucket for storing effects as discussed earlier. If you are not familiar with the characteristics of the WeakMap class, you can learn more about it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap">here</a>.</p>

<p>A loader is a node module exported as a function. This function is called when transforming resources in the loader. The given function will utilize the <code>Loader API</code> and can be accessed through the <code>this</code> context.</p>
<p>Here is an official link on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/writing-a-loader">loader usage and examples, including local development and testing of custom loaders</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="simple-usage-of-webpack-loader">Simple Usage of Webpack Loader</span></h2>
<p>When a loader is used in a resource, it can only take one parameter - a string containing the content of the resource file.</p>
<p>Synchronous loaders can return a single value representing the transformed module.</p>
<p>Loaders can return one or two values. The first value is a string or buffer containing JavaScript code. The optional second value is a SourceMap, which is a JavaScript object.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of using a loader. It matches all JavaScript files and processes them using <code>loader.js</code>:</p>

<p>From the above, we can understand how loaders are used. But this only scratches the surface. What does a specific loader look like?</p>
<p>For example, a simple loader could be like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript">module<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function-variable function">exports</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">content</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
	<span class="token comment">// content is the source content string passed in</span>
  <span class="token keyword">return</span> content
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>A loader is just a node module exposing a function that can only receive one parameter: a string containing the content of the resource file. The function’s return value is the processed content.</p>

<h3><span id="guidelines-for-using-custom-loaders">Guidelines for Using Custom Loaders</span></h3>
<p>When writing loaders, you should follow these guidelines. They are listed in order of importance, and some apply only to specific scenarios. Please read the detailed sections below for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it <strong>simple</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>chaining</strong>.</li>
<li>Output should be <strong>modular</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure it’s <strong>stateless</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>loader utilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Record <strong>loader dependencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Resolve <strong>module dependencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Extract <strong>common code</strong>.</li>
<li>Avoid <strong>absolute paths</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>peer dependencies</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="step-1-create-project-directory-and-files">Step 1: Create Project Directory and Files</span></h3>
<p>First, create the following files in a folder within your webpack project directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/loader/custom-loader.js</code>: The source file for your custom loader.</li>
<li><code>src/index.js</code>: JavaScript entry file for testing the custom loader.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="step-2-write-the-custom-loader">Step 2: Write the Custom Loader</span></h3>
<p>In the <code>custom-loader.js</code> file, write your custom loader code. This loader adds a comment at the top of each loaded JavaScript file.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// src/loader/custom-loader.js</span>

<p>This configuration achieves a simple functionality. Now let’s discuss how to test the local loader. There are two ways to do this: one is through <code>Npm link</code> for testing, a convenient method where you can create a symbolic link for local testing. Here is a link to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-link">npm-link</a>. Another way is to configure the path directly in the project:</p>

## Simple Usage of Webpack Plugin

Plugins provide complete control over the webpack engine for third-party developers. By introducing custom behaviors into the webpack build process through stage-based build callbacks, developers can customize webpack&#39;s behavior.

Here&#39;s the simplest example:

&#96;&#96;&#96;javascript
&#x2F;&#x2F; webpack.config.js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin &#x3D; require(&#39;html-webpack-plugin&#39;);

module.exports &#x3D; &#123;
    entry: &#39;.&#x2F;src&#x2F;index.js&#39;,
    output: &#123;
        filename: &#39;bundle.js&#39;,
        path: __dirname + &#39;&#x2F;dist&#39;,
    &#125;,
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin(&#123;
            template: &#39;.&#x2F;src&#x2F;index.html&#39;, &#x2F;&#x2F; Specify the HTML template file
            filename: &#39;index.html&#39;, &#x2F;&#x2F; Generated HTML file name
        &#125;),
        &#x2F;&#x2F; You can add more plugins here
    ],
&#125;;<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> is used. It generates a new HTML file based on the specified HTML template and automatically adds the bundled JavaScript file to the generated HTML file.</p>
<p>A basic webpack plugin consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A JavaScript named function or JavaScript class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define an <code>apply</code> method on the plugin function’s prototype. The <code>apply</code> method is called when webpack loads the plugin and is passed the <code>compiler</code> object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify an event hook bound to webpack itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process specific data from webpack’s internal instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the callback provided by webpack after the functionality is completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A plugin structure looks like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">HelloWorldPlugin</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>

      <span class="token string">'Hello World Plugin'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">(</span>
        stats <span class="token comment">/* After binding the done hook, stats is passed as a parameter. */</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
        console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'Hello World!'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>

<h2><span id="compiler-and-compilation">Compiler and Compilation</span></h2>
<p>The two most important resources in plugin development are the <code>compiler</code> and <code>compilation</code> objects. Plugin development revolves around hooks on these objects.</p>
<p>The <code>compiler</code> object is essentially bound to the entire webpack environment. It contains all the environment configurations, including options, loaders, and plugins. When webpack starts, this object is instantiated and it is <code>globally unique</code>. The parameters passed into the <code>apply</code> method are properties of this object.</p>
<p>The <code>compilation</code> object is created each time resources are built. It represents the current module resources, compiled generated resources, changed files, and tracked dependency status. It also provides many hooks.</p>

        <h2><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>When configuring redirects on a website, especially in the following scenarios, issues can arise:</p>
<p><strong>Redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS:</strong> Suppose you’ve set up an SSL certificate to upgrade your website from HTTP to HTTPS. If problems occur during this process, rendering the site inaccessible, you might consider reverting to the HTTP version. However, the challenge arises once a permanent 301 redirection is in place. Even if you remove the redirection on the server, browsers retain this information. Consequently, users’ browsers continue to enforce the HTTPS redirection, preventing them from accessing the HTTP version.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the Website Domain:</strong> When migrating a website from one domain (such as <code>old-domain.com</code>) to another (such as <code>new-domain.com</code>), a permanent 301 redirection is often employed. This informs search engines and browsers that the site has permanently moved to a new domain. However, if complications arise during this process, you may wish to undo the redirection, allowing users to access the old domain again. Unfortunately, due to browser hard caching of 301 redirections, users become permanently redirected to the new domain, unable to revisit the old one.</p>
<p>To avoid such situations, it is advisable to use a temporary 302 redirection initially, ensuring everything functions correctly. Unlike a 301 redirection, a 302 redirection is not permanently cached by browsers. This means that if necessary, you can revert the redirection without users being permanently locked into the new URL. This approach eliminates the need for users to manually clear their browser caches, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>301 Redirection:</strong> Indicates that a resource (page) has permanently moved to a new location. The client/browser should not attempt to request the original location but use the new location from now on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>302 Redirection:</strong> Indicates that the resource is temporarily located elsewhere, and the client/browser should continue requesting the original URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A 301 redirection is permanent, meaning that even if removed from the server, browsers will perpetually redirect resources to the new domain or HTTPS due to hard caching.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a 302 redirection is not hard-cached by browsers. If you remove the redirection from your server (website), you can still access the old version.</p>
<p>Clearing 301/302 redirection cache typically involves clearing browser cache or the operating system’s DNS cache. Here’s how to do it on different platforms:</p>

        <p>Webpack v4 introduced a new feature called <code>sideEffects</code>, which allows you to declare in your <code>package.json</code> whether a package/module contains side effects or not. This declaration provides more optimization space for tree-shaking.</p>
<p>In the conventional understanding of side effects, if we are certain that the modules within our package have no side effects, we can mark the package in <code>npm</code> with <code>&quot;sideEffects&quot;: false</code> in <code>package.json</code>. This allows us to offer a better bundling experience for consumers. The principle behind this is that Webpack can transform imports like <code>import &#123;a&#125; from xx</code> into <code>import &#123;a&#125; from 'xx/a'</code> for packages marked as side-effects-free, automatically trimming unnecessary imports, similar to <code>babel-plugin-import</code>.</p>
<h2><span id="tree-shaking-and-side-effects">Tree Shaking and Side Effects</span></h2>
<p>Tree shaking, first introduced and implemented by Rollup in the frontend community, has been a topic of discussion in various articles about optimizing bundling.</p>
<h3><span id="principles-of-tree-shaking">Principles of Tree Shaking</span></h3>
<p>ES6 module imports are statically analyzable, meaning the compiler can accurately determine what code is loaded during compilation. The program flow is analyzed to identify unused or unreferenced variables, which are then removed from the code.</p>
<p>The principle sounds perfect, so why do we sometimes find that unnecessary code in our projects isn’t eliminated? The reason is side effects.</p>
<h3><span id="side-effects">Side Effects</span></h3>
<p>For those familiar with functional programming, the term “side effect” is not unfamiliar. It can be broadly understood as any action of a function that might or might not affect variables outside its scope.</p>
<p>For example, consider this function:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">go</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">url</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>location<span class="token punctuation">.</span>href <span class="token operator">=</span> url<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>This function modifies the global variable <code>location</code> and even triggers a browser redirect, making it a function with side effects.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// components.js</span>

<p>In this code, the <code>Person</code> class is clearly unused. However, why can other tools like Rollup successfully eliminate unused code, while Webpack cannot?</p>
<p>The answer lies in <strong>Babel compilation + Webpack bundling</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ll provide a link here that explains in detail how Babel compilation + Webpack bundling might prevent effective code elimination: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32831172">Your Tree-Shaking Isn’t Working</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to read the article, here’s a brief explanation: Babel compilation wraps the <code>Person</code> class in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and returns a constructor, introducing a side effect.</p>
<p>There’s an issue related to this: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/1261">Class declarations inside IIFEs are considered side effects</a>.</p>
<p>When I declare a class inside an IIFE and don’t use the class, UglifyJS doesn’t remove it because it’s considered a side effect.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">var</span> V6Engine <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">V6Engine</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
    <span class="token class-name">V6Engine</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>prototype<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function-variable function">toString</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token string">'V6'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<p>During compilation, you might receive this warning: <code>WARN: Side effects in initialization of unused variable V6Engine [./dist/car.bundle.js:74,4]</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that UglifyJS doesn’t perform complete program flow analysis. It doesn’t remove code because you noticed a side effect. If you want a more sophisticated tree shaking, go check out Rollup!</p>
<p>Summarizing some key points from the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a function’s parameter is a reference type, any operations on its properties could potentially have side effects. This is because it’s a reference type, and any modification to its properties affects data outside the function. Additionally, accessing or modifying its properties triggers <code>getter</code> or <code>setter</code>, which are opaque and may have side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UglifyJS lacks complete program flow analysis. It can simple judge whether a variable is later referenced or modified but cannot determine the complete modification process of a variable. It doesn’t know if it points to an external variable, so many potentially side-effect-causing code cannot be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rollup has the ability to perform program flow analysis, making it better at determining whether code truly has side effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these issues were prevalent in older versions. The current Webpack <code>tree shaking</code> has undergone many optimizations and can perform sufficient program flow analysis for <code>tree shaking</code>.</p>
<p>The purpose of Webpack’s <code>tree shaking</code> is to mark unused <code>exported members</code> as <code>unused</code> and not export them in the modules where they are <code>re-exported</code>. It sounds complicated, but looking at the code makes it clearer:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// a.js</span>

<p>When using <code>app.js</code> as the entry point, the code after tree shaking becomes:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// a.js</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">a</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span><span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>

<span class="token comment">// package/index.js does not export module b anymore</span>

<p>After combining Webpack’s <code>scope hoisting</code> and <code>uglify</code>, all traces of module <code>b</code> will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>But what if module <code>b</code> contains some side effects, such as a simple log:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// b.js</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">b</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">v</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> v <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>

After webpack<span class="token punctuation">,</span> the content <span class="token keyword">of</span> module <span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string">b</span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span> <span class="token literal-property property">becomes</span><span class="token operator">:</span>

<span class="token comment">// b.js</span>

<p>Although the export of module <code>b</code> is ignored, the code with side effects is retained.</p>
<p>Due to various strange operations introduced by the <code>transformer</code> after compilation, which may cause side effects, we often find that even with tree shaking, our <code>bundle size</code> doesn’t significantly decrease.</p>
<p>Usually, we expect that if module <code>b</code> is not being used, none of its code should be included.</p>
<p>This is where the role of <code>sideEffects</code> becomes apparent: if the imported package/module is marked as <code>&quot;sideEffects: false&quot;</code>, regardless of whether it truly has side effects, as long as it’s not being referenced, the entire module/package will be completely removed.</p>
<p>Taking <code>mobx-react-devtools</code> as an example, we often use it like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript" data-language="javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">import</span> DevTools <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'mobx-react-devtools'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">MyApp</span> <span class="token keyword">extends</span> <span class="token class-name">React<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Component</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
  <span class="token function">render</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>
      <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>div<span class="token operator">></span>
        <span class="token operator">...</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span> process<span class="token punctuation">.</span>env<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token constant">NODE_ENV</span> <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">'production'</span> <span class="token operator">?</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span> <span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>DevTools <span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
      <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>div<span class="token operator">></span>
    <span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is a common scenario of importing modules on demand. However, without the <code>sideEffects: false</code> configuration, even if <code>NODE_ENV</code> is set to <code>production</code>, the bundled code will still include the <code>mobx-react-devtools</code> package. Although we haven’t used any of its exported members, <code>mobx-react-devtools</code> will still be imported because it “might” have side effects.</p>
<p>But when we add <code>sideEffects: false</code>, tree shaking can safely remove it entirely from the bundle.</p>
<h2><span id="use-cases-of-sideeffects">Use Cases of sideEffects</span></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s often difficult to guarantee whether packages/modules published on npm contain side effects (it could be the code’s fault or the transformer’s fault). However, we can usually ensure whether a package/module will affect objects outside of it, such as modifying properties on the <code>window</code> object or overwriting native object methods. If we can guarantee this, we can determine whether a package can have <code>&quot;sideEffects: false&quot;</code>. Whether it truly has side effects is not that important for Webpack; it’s acceptable as long as it’s marked.</p>
<p>This explains why packages with inherent side effects, like <code>vue</code>, can still have <code>&quot;sideEffects: false&quot;</code> applied.</p>
<p>So, in Webpack, <code>&quot;sideEffects: false&quot;</code> doesn’t mean that the module truly has no side effects. It’s just a way to tell Webpack during tree shaking: “I designed this package with the expectation that it has no side effects, even if it ends up having side effects after being bundled.”</p>
